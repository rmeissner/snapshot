`params.coeff` tokens to their score for every 1 token sent. \\n\\nThis creates a new fundraising opportunity for projects & organizations, levels the playing field for less wealthy participants, and encourages voters to \\\"put their money where their mouth is\\\".\\n\\n## Params\\n\\n- `contractAddress` - (**Required**, `string`) Address of ERC20 token contract\\n- `decimals` - (**Required**, `number`) Decimal precision for ERC20 token\\n- `receivingAddresses` - (**Required**, `string[]`) Array of addresses to check for ERC20 transactions from voters\\n- `coeff` - (**Optional**, `number`, Default: `1`) Amount to multiply the sum of a voter's ERC20 sent to `receivingAddresses`. When used in conjunction with other strategies, this enables the increase or decrease of leverage given to voter who send tokens.\\n- `dfuseApiKey` - (**Optional**, `string`, Default: contributor's test key) - Customize Dfuse API key\\n\\n\\n## Examples\\n\\nCan be used instead of, or in conjunction with erc20-balance-of strategy. \\nIn this example, the `params.coeff` of `100` makes a 1 token donation equivalent to a balance of 100 tokens. Thus, giving voters a massive incentive to donate.\\n\\nThe space config will look like this:\\n\\n```JSON\\n\\\"strategies\\\": [\\n  {\\n    \\\"name\\\": \\\"Example ERC20-Received Strategy\\\",\\n
